# measure-distances-in-Chimera

A python script that generates text which can be pasted into the command line of UCSF Chimera to obtain the minimum pairwise distances between a set of selected residues in a protein crystal structure. Works with both Chimera and Chimera X, but the latter appears to have a limit on the amount of text that can be pasted into the command line, limiting the nubmer of sites that can be measured at once.
